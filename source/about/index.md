Hello, I'm Martin and I build websites. Most of the time, I think of myself as a front-end developer but I have tinkered with most of the web stack throughout my career. For the most part, I am interested in CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and Node.

I'm currently working for [Simply Business](http://www.simplybusiness.co.uk/), an online UK insurer for small businesses.

## Colophon

**1 Pixel Out** is built on [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), an open source static site generator and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The CSS is written with [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) and the theme templates with the [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templating engine.

The theme design is inspired by the excellent [Ghostwriter](http://ghost.jollygoodthemes.com/ghostwriter/) theme by [JollyGoodThemes](http://ghost.jollygoodthemes.com/).

### Fonts

- [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans)
- [Source Code Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Code+Pro) for code snippets. I highly recommend this font for monospaced uses.
